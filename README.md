[RStudio addins](https://rstudio.github.io/rstudioaddins/) were released in early 2016 to provide anyone with the ability to add "extensions" to RStudio. This feature has quickly become popular, but discoverability was a problem: **there's just no easy way to know what addins exist.**

The `addinslist` package solves that problem in two ways:

- This package provides a continuously updated list of RStudio addins that you can browse through ([below](#addinslist-table)).

- After installing this package (`install.packages('addinslist')`), your RStudio will get populated with a new addin called "Browse RStudio addins". This addin allows you to interactively browse through the list of addins, see which ones you already have installed, and let you install/uninstall the corresponding package of each addin. The following image shows how to access this "addin of addins" in RStudio.
